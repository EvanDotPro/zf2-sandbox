# ZF2 MVC + Modules Prototype Tutorial
Written by [Evan Coury](http://evan.pro/)

## Updates have rendered this tutorial obsolete

The tutorial that occupied this file in previous commits is now out of date. You
may browse to it in older commits for reference, but the steps will no longer
work on my provided repositories. I may update this with a new tutorial at a
later date.
