Evan's ZF2 Sandbox
==================
Version 0.0.1 Created by Evan Coury

Introduction
------------
This is just an area for me to mess around with ZF2 and try out various
concepts. You may use it for reference / learning, but please do not use
anything in this repository for anything close to production use. Everything
here is **very** unstable.

Installation
------------
This is the easiest way to get the fully functional project, including the proper 
version of ZF2:

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/EvanDotPro/zf2-sandbox.git
