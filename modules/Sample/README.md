Sample Module
=============

This is just a vanilla sample module showing the bare bones of a module that
provides a controller and view. The Application module is a bit over-complicated
since it's moreso the "main" module, meaning it contains most of the global
config stuff, bootstrap class, etc. I've also set this one up to use the
standard autoloader instead of a classmap.
